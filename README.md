# GitHub Insights

The goal is to create an app that leverages GitHub's REST API in order to give insights on repositories, users, organizations...

The App will have:

- A Tab for *Trendring Repositories*
- A Tab for *Search*
- A Tab for *Profile*

Additional Screens will be added to support Authentication and more detailed Views.

The authentication of the user will consist in typing his username in a TextField.

After that the username will be stored locally for later launches.

The user will have the option to sign out, essentially resetting the stored value.

## Steps:

- [ ] Add Filter to Trending Search
