# GitHub Insights

The goal is to create an app that leverages GitHub's REST API in order to give insights on repositories, users, organizations...

The App will have:

- A Tab for *Trendring Repositories*
- A Tab for *Search*
- A Tab for *Profile*

Additional Screens will be added to support Authentication and more detailled Views.
